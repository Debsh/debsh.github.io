I am a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley in the EECS department. I finished my undergrad at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia in Electrical and Computer Engineering and received my Masters of Science in CS from UC Berkeley in 2023. I am currently co-advised by Prof. [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) and Prof. [John Canny](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/canny.html). I am part of [PLAIT](https://plait-lab.org/), [CannyLab](https://cannylab.github.io/) and [BAIR.](https://bair.berkeley.edu/index.html#header)
 
My research interest broadly lies in the intersection of AI and HCI, with a focus on making usable AI tools accessible to end users. I am currently looking into making NLP tools usable and accessible for low-resourced languages. I am also interested in the impact of AI on society, specifically in how it affects Global Majority countries and communities. 

Outside of research, I like to read books📚, make and drink traditional Ethiopian coffee☕, knit🧣,  explore art🎨, and write✍️.
