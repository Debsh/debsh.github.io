My name is Debora Taye, and I am currently an MSc student in Computer Engineering at Addis Ababa University. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Jimma University in Ethiopia. Currently, I am co-advised By [Dr. Bisrat.A]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bisrat-derebssa-383b63100?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BzlK%2B4yLCTY%2BSjPvVJsn89Q%3D%3D)) and [Hellina.N]([url](https://github.com/hhnigatu/hhnigatu.github.io)). 

My research interest broadly lies in the NLP, with a focus on making MT betwean local languages of Ethiopia. I am currently looking into making NLP tools usable and accessible for low-resourced languages. 

In my free time, I enjoy indulging in my love for literature and art. Reading books allows me to expand my horizons and gain new perspectives on the world. I find great fulfillment in losing myself in the written word, as it enables me to explore diverse ideas and narratives.
