Senoir Fellow for the [DSSJ 2024](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-science-social-justice) summer program where I co-teach and co-mentor students on fundamenatals of langauge processing and readings related to Fairness Accountability and Transparency. 

Happy to share my [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16656) on YouTube harm was a featrured reading for the Misuse of Data Science and Machine Learning discussion.
