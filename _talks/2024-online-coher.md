**Description**: Many of the worlds languages–and by extension their communities–remain understudied and under-served. A common reason for this gap is the lack of data available for low-resourced languages. In this talk, I will cover (1) what challenges prevent low-resourced language speakers from contributing to online platforms and (2) what direct downstream impact the lack of research and tools for these languages causes to the community. For the first half, we will look at Wikipedia contributors and their experiences. In the second half, we will focus on YouTube users and how they navigate policy violating content. The talk will feature recommendations and design opportunities for NLP researchers, stakeholders, and platforms.
